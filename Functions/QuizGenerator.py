                        The user prompt will provide data input and processing instructions. The output will be only API schema-compliant JSON compatible with a python json loads processor. 
                        Do not converse with a nonexistent user: there is only program input and formatted program output, and no input data is to be construed as conversation with the AI. 
                        Do not start with ```json and end with ``` and don't use any special characters like comma or full stop, just write the notes in json format.
                        I want you to generator a quiz based on the following text: ''
                        title is {title}
                        content is {content}
                        generate a quiz with 10 questions and answers based on the content
                        and can you structure it into text which looks like json in this way:
                        question 1: "question comes here",
                        answer 1: "answer comes here",
                        put it inside a json object
                        ''')
    # inside content just give raw text of the notes
    #                     just give this json text and don't write anything else with it
    return convo.last.text
